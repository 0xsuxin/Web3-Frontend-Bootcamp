# Project Submission Guidelines

## Submission Process

1. Enter the official [GitHub](https://github.com/openbuildxyz/Web3-Frontend-Bootcamp/blob/main/Projects/readme.md) - `Web3-Frontend-Bootcamp` repository of the hackathon.

2. Select "**Fork**" to copy the official repository to your personal GitHub repository;

   Note: "Fork" means creating a personal copy of the repository. You can make any changes on the personal copy and submit those changes to the original repository, and the admin will review and merge your changes.

3. Clone the copy of the Forked repository to your device;

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/openbuildxyz/Web3-Frontend-Bootcamp.git
   ```

4. Arrange the files on your own device: First, create a personal project folder (take the name of your corresponding project) under the division folder, and place the files to be submitted in the personal folder.
